# About

I started this blog a couple years ago to give myself the opportunity to learn git and also publish some rambling thoughts about stuff I find interesting. Rn it seems I'm just using it to complain abou my life. Unforunately, that's probably an honest reflection of my typical day to day dialouge. Better to spew that nonsense to the void than bother some real people, I think.

Anyway, enough about why blog and more about who me. I studied Business Administration at the University of Southern California with a concentration in Applied Analytics. After school I got a job as an information security consultant and have been working in that position for about two years. I'm fascinated by all kinds of things! Throughout my entire life I've loved learning about history but now more recently my interests have turned more towards technology in whatever shape that may take. Meet me at the art of intersecting technology.
