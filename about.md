# About

I am from Darien, Connecticut but have been living in Los Angeles, CA for the past 5 years. I attended the University of Southern California and graduated in 3.5 years with a degree in Business Administration from the Marshall School of Business with a certificate from the Viterbi School of Engineering in Applied Analytics. I am analytical but empathetic in that I am able to communicate using hard numbers while still maintaining an appreciation of the uncertainty and messiness of the reality that numbers try to model. 

I am writing this blog to practice my data science skills. I am interested in the application of machine learning to disparate fields like basketball or linguistics but I figured I'd need a unified, public-facing platform to publish on that would encourage me to improve my communication skills. Now that I'm not in school and working full-time, I noticed I missed the classes like English that had different styles of writing challenges from persuasive to pedagogical. This blog will hopefully give me the opportunity to "fail fast" at writing and explaining data science projects. I can already see I have a lot of fluff to cut down in this little bio :)
