Blah blah blah

idk what to write. i am so bored during the holidays and now my roommate most likely has covid. So I have to stay out of my nyc apartment for another 10 days. SMH. C'est la vie. Say lavee. 

let's just start vomming zee words and eventually i will learn computational linear algebra

SVD: singular value decomposition. exact decomposition into long and skinny matrix. guy at work told me it was inexact so then i never worked with him again because i didn't know whether i could trust him! i should've just asked to confirm but i did not and life went on :/
exact decomposition in my words: like when you uh have uh a matrix and it's like got two dimensions (l x w in general case) 4x3 in actual numerical analysis

so like you take one matrix and then you decompose it into two matrices. the long matrix represents sorta like a PCA thingy and the short matrix represents something else i can't remember. let's go back and look through my notes.
