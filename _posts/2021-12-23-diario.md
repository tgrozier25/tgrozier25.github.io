## Why I'm writing a blog

tldr: experiential learning is best plus i wanna program better

Let's go back to the beginning of my life as a wee lad. I loved to read and get lost in books but math never held the same sway over me. Reading about math was fun and when I fully understood something computation was an easy way to hit a flow. But at the same time, there was one gigantic flaw. I now know a semi-intelligible name for this flaw whcih I will say "is it n or n+1"? Meaning, when you do 20-15 you get 5 (now let's do this in python cuz y not): 

```python
# prints "5"
print(20-15)
```

Here we go. We have 5. But what about days of the month? Sometimes (and even know I can feel my collar getting hot) you would subtract the 21st of November from the 17th of November and get 4 or 5. I guess a more specific way of looking at it is like numerical error because of lack of precision or whatever but to be honest I came across this once in elementary school, I never asked, and it haunted me for the rest of my life. The anxiety persisted and the avoidance began. Oh well no use crying over spilled milk. Here we are now. Same Timmy only with way more knowledge about a lot more stuff. But the anxiety of math sorta persists? But now it's been replaced by "Oh i didn't study this in college so I have no right to speak in that language". This is not egalite! So I must submit myself to more sadistic studying in the hope that if I bow my head I will be annointed and not beheaded. I also might just go learn Haskell cuz I drank too much PG/Leibniz kool aid and want to legitimate myself.


Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:

---

## Lists

Here's a list:

- item 1
- item 2

And a numbered list:

1. item 1
1. item 2

## Boxes and stuff

> This is a quotation

{% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %}

...and...

{% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}

## Images

![](/images/logo.png "fast.ai's logo")

## Code

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```

    2
