# i am rapid test hovyid positive

Visiting home for the holidays and i have yet another breakthrough yase. lol luv my lyfe! instead of getting mad i am just gna study some math to take my mind off things. this is more healthy than ruminating and getting annoyed at stuff.

anyway. first order of business is.. let's do basic conditional probability that i actually have covid given a positive test result.

sketch this out in my head. we have confusion matrix which is 2x2 matrix. we have true positive, true negative, false positive and false negative. the reason why it's called a confusion matrix imo is cuz you see a 2x2 and you fall over yourself trying to do it quickly and end up confused. holy moly. 

ideally what i want to do is something that 1. interests me and 2. demonstrates my ability. self-legitimation n allat ya dunno. shto ya hochu, tak, nye znayo potomuu shto ceichase mhne nye nrabitzya moya rabota.

```python
import numpy as np
array([[0,1],
       [1,0]])
