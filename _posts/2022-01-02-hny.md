# Happy New Year!

New year new me same old bs. Almost forgot about the blog for a second but we back like we never left. Yardi know🤷‍♀️. <- I just learned how to insert emojis no way.

What has happened recently. Well, my covid came and went. Disappointed in the actions of those around me per usual but I'll leave it at that. Christmas was meh and New Years was similarly meh. I got some good gifts for the apartment so I'm pleased about that. Wish I could've spent more time with my family but I will be back soon enough to pick up my contacts and then I'll take my mom out for some food. Believe that!

## Music I'm listening to rn

Couple things here. All the music I listen to on a regular basis is stored in a giant playlist called "Twerk Out" that I made when I was like 14 years old. Though the name was not and has never been cool I keep it cuz it's kinda funny and a nice memory. But let's think about how I listened to music over time. The first music player I had was the ipod shuffle. I downloaded my Dad's library onto it and the singular memory I have of that was listening to an incredible Uncle Cracker (or an artist of that ilk) song .. and then never hearing it again. What a ridiculous device. I was so jealous of my dad's ipod classic especially because he had movies on it and everything. Amazing. I don't remember pirating music until like middle or high school. Even then cuz I was on apple it was difficult to get mp3 files into iTunes. But I had incredible mega rips of playboi carti leaks that had amazing music. But of course going from iTunes to Spotify sucked cuz it was another process of getting lured into something only for them to pull up the gates and you realizing that it's a walled garden heavy emphasis on the wall. 

Enough of the trip down memory lane. I am currently listening to some music by Natalie Lafourcade & Los Macorinos. From what I gather, it's an album performing different Latinoamericano folklore songs. It's really really good. Natalie has such a beautiful voice and the lyrics are hauntingly beautiful. S/o to Los Macorinos as well they did their thing. My favorite song is "Soledad y el Mar" - so lovely. I will go listen to it while I'm walking alongside the East River! I just recently found out I could walk over there. I might even take the ferry to Brooklyn! 😎

Saluditos a mi reina. La cosa k me pone pensando ahorita es donde y como me puedo mejorar mi espanol. No conozco ningun hispanohablante en nueva york y ademas pues me aburra hablando ingles todo el tiempo. Tmb pues ya no me he pasado mucho tiempo con nueva yorquinos asi la cultura hispanohablante es un poco diferente a Los Angeles digo. Vamos a ver.
