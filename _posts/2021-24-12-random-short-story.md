# The dock

The royal baby had been swaddled in clothes befitting his stature. Placed onto a waiting barge, he floated away beneath the mist of the night. A torch was the only illumination - the light made to roll by the carress of the river, amplified and shrunk through no fault of its own. 

Carried along, the barge carved with the current. The light was seen from the banks until it wasn't.
