## Why I hate autofiction

Now hate is a strong word. One might say strongly dislike instead. But you're not supposed to use adverbs and so we stay hating.

this book had gotten rave reviews and i was hella bored/read the new yorker profile so i was like lessgo

anyway, read the book and i very much liked it. in the face of maximal noise from the outside world we all have that small impulse to shut it all out. Some achieve that through hobbies like music or reading and some do it through drug addiction. Since this is a book review and not a moralizing seminar I will just say 

| ok

iirc, there's parts where this weird art dude is taking photos of her while she exists in this state of half awake/half asleep - seemingly conscious but lacking control over herself. and it's like at first you think wow. this kinda writing is novel and hip and just oh so esoteric. then you realize damn they're just talking about same old boring philosophical dialectics set amongst horrible people. what kinda life is this! all the characters suck (cuz morality is a construct of the petite bourgeiose or whatever so no one is allowed to be good aside from the memories of people long gone cuz hagiographies luv overlooking faults), the writing is good whatever but still, and then at the end you're just left with the urge to stare into your navel until your spine snaps. 

which leads me to my next rant. yes the ambiguity of agency induced by drug addiction is a cool concept. and we're right to treat addiction like a disease which logically entails acknowledging that people on drugs are not fully in control of their actions. damn - now i'm just appreciating the book even more lmfao. ok fine i change my mind good book. i still dislike autofiction for how neurotic it is tho. 

I was trying to be a good patriot and read the other book that was ukrain - - ya nationalism and it was tha same. center and periphery. periphery brought to perform their esoteric rites of individuality. and it's just sooooooo boring. let's have a long monologue listing all the different republics in the russian federation! wow so many! wow good points about federalism! oh no bad points about federalism! i can't live how i was meant to because i thought one day to myself 

| i should become a writer

bah humbug. woe is us. self-flagellation as rite of penance before i'm allowed to eat in the morning. such is the ecosystem in which i live i suppose.
